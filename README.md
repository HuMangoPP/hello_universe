# Hello Universe

### Hello Universe reinvented in PyGame.

Currently in the very early prototyping stage. Sorely lacking in polish, gameplay, and aesthetics.

I have outlined the main systems which the gameplay will be built upon.

Let's see if I can coke up a way to animate these creatures procedurally without access to standard models and meshes typically offered by a game engine.

### Instructions

[Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Download and unzip the repository. 

Enter your venv, if desired, or don't, and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` if the first one doesn't work.

Next, run ```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py``` or simply the file ```main.py``` from the root directory.
