# Hello Universe

### Hello Universe reinvented in PyGame.

Currently in the very early prototyping stage. Sorely lacking in polish, gameplay, and aesthetics.

I have outlined the main systems which the gameplay will be built upon.

Let's see if I can coke up a way to animate these creatures procedurally without access to standard models and meshes typically offered by a game engine.

### Instructions

[Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

[PyGame Installation](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

Download and unzip the repository. Run ```python main.py```,  ```python3 main.py```, or ```./main.py``` from the root directory. Otherwise, the assets won't load properly and also because I don't know how to use packages.
